                    <h3>City of Angels</h3>
                    <p>Chinese starlet Angelababy took time out of her hectic, jetsetting schedule to spend her summer in Brussels with GODIVA, to indulge in the world of the premium chocolatier as well as explore its home city. Not surprisingly, she instantly fell in love with the city and had a first-hand taste of why Belgium is synonymous with the world’s best chocolate.</p>
                    <p>“Brussels is also the land of angels,” Angelababy exclaimed. “The whole city is full of angel sculptures, which I found very romantic and beautiful.” Enchanted by the must-see tourist landmarks of the Grand Place and Manneken-Pis, Baby found beauty in the city’s historical touches — from luxurious decorations on buildings to gold finishes on interiors, and statues telling age-old stories. “This city is so amorous and exciting, full of famous historical landmarks and beautiful monuments, so much rich art and culture, amazing food, as well as chocolate everywhere! I really felt like a princess here and it’s definitely one of my favourite cities.”</p>

                    <h3>Chocolate Fantasy</h3>
                    <p>The sweet, demure star was enthralled by her visit to the GODIVA Chocolate Factory — with its incredible mini chocolate lake. “I kept wondering what a chocolate factory would look like,” Baby explained, “and I imagined it to be like the ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ movie. The setting made me feel like a little kid with a huge imagination. When I watched the ganaches get covered in dark chocolate, I thought of them as children in a line who were about to jump around to shake off the excess muddy drip.”</p>
                    <p>At the factory, she enjoyed chocolate-making demonstrations to learn more about the craftsmanship behind the sweet delicacies, and developed a profound appreciation for the skill and complexities behind the processes. “I was lucky to taste fresh handmade chocolates,” she said, “as well as learn how to make ganache-centred chocolates, which I’m definitely making at home.”</p>
                    <p>Her trip also included a visit to the GODIVA Sablon store, which is a quaint and true brand experience, as well as the Chocolate Museum, which showcases why Belgium is the grand master of chocolate.</p>
